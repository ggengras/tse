In the midst of development ...

To build, run `make`.

To clean up, run `make clean`.

There is NO global `make test` yet, to test the crawler go to the crawler
directory and `make test`.

*Only* run the crawler on this domain to keep everyone happy:
`http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/data/tse`

NOTE::: Currently, makefile in libcs50 is configured to use the CS50 data structures
and not mine, but my .c files are in the libcs50 folder for when I get around to
fixing their memory leaks.
