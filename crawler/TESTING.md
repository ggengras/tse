# Testing crawler.c
## Graeme Gengras, April 2018

To test crawler.c, I wrote two programs: `testcrawler_unit.c` to perform unit testing (making sure each function in crawler.c does what it is supposed to) and `testcrawler_int.sh` to perform integration testing (making sure crawler.c does what it is supposed to do given a wide range of input).
